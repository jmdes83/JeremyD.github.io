My name is Jeremy Desiderio and I work independently on data analysis projects. I have a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Ursinus College and am a graduate of the Data Scientist program through Dataquest.

There is simply nothing I enjoy more than analyzing real-world data to uncover hidden trends and patterns within. For as long as I can remember, I have had a special affinity for numbers, and central to my thought processes has always been a special regard for facts and logic.

I have twelve years’ professional experience as an auditor, five of which were spent in a data analytics capacity. Having found the analytical aspect of my work to be the most meaningful as well as personally rewarding, I have since decided to pursue data analytics as a full-time occupation.
